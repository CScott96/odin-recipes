        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Follow these 3 key techniques so Chef John's lemon poppy seed pancakes turn out perfectly: give the lemon zest and sugar time to react, whisk the batter just enough and not too much, and have enough patience to let the batter rest for 10 minutes before cooking. You'll be rewarded with delicious, fluffy pancakes.</p>
